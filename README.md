# React Native Third-Party Library Linkage Issue

This repository demonstrates a common but often difficult-to-diagnose bug in React Native: problems linking and using third-party libraries.  The primary symptom is app crashes or blank screens upon invoking library functions.

The `ThirdPartyLibraryBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, exhibiting the failure to link a hypothetical library.  The solution, detailed in `ThirdPartyLibrarySolution.js`, involves verifying the library's installation, linking process, and correct import statements within your React Native application.
