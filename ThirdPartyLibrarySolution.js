To resolve this issue, carefully review your project's setup and the library's documentation.  Ensure that the library is installed correctly (using `npm install` or `yarn add`), and that the appropriate native modules are linked. For iOS, this might involve using `pod install`, while Android may require manual configuration within `android/app/build.gradle`.  

After correctly installing and linking, verify the import statement in your code. The correct module import path should be checked for correctness, and the usage should be reviewed.   Incorrect usage might not trigger explicit errors but still lead to crashes. Here's an example of the corrected code:

```javascript
import {ExampleComponent} from 'react-native-example-library'; // Correct import path

// ... rest of your component code ...
<ExampleComponent/>
```

If the issue persists, consult the library's documentation for platform-specific instructions and troubleshooting guides.  Check for any known issues or compatibility problems in the library's issue tracker.
